Media Queries

    Q4 - What is the best CSS property and why?
*/


I'm not exactly sure if there is a "best" property.
I know there are a lot of important properties.

But if this is my opinion then I would have to say Media Queries.
Although I am terrible at them, they are very important because
most websites nowadays are viewed either on a phone or tablet vs. PC's.
So it's very important to have your website responsive so that it looks proper and modern to all devices.

It is also important that I get better at them..... :(
